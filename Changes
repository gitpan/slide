        STUFF DONE:
        * Fixed some HTML in the default templates.

        * All template files now end in .tt in the distro.

        * Removed the "click anywhere on the page" JavaScript.

        Raw from Casey West's original "slod" system.

        This is so alpha it hurts to even think about it.  Stuff
        is going to change like crazy.  It works, sort of.  There
        will be changes coming down the pipe, and I'm not even going
        to document them!  THAT'S how alpha this baby is.

        So if you want to use it, go ahead, but otherwise, wait a
        few days.
