Revision history for Perl extension App::Slide

0.01	Wed Jan  7 22:30:51 CST 2004

	Raw from Casey West's original "slod" system.

	This is so alpha it hurts to even think about it.  Stuff
	is going to change like crazy.  It works, sort of.  There
	will be changes coming down the pipe, and I'm not even going
	to document them!  THAT'S how alpha this baby is.

	So if you want to use it, go ahead, but otherwise, wait a
	few days.
